{"time":1706718045130,"data":{"text":"The audit for SushiToken (SUSHI) has successfully concluded with positive evaluations. First and foremost, there are no sell or buy taxes implemented on this particular token, which is a significant advantage for traders as it removes extra financial burden in the trading process. \n\nSUSHI has been analyzed and affirmed to not be a honeypot. As is typical with most tokens, it provides open and fair access to traders, demonstrating a level playing field for all participants in the market. The absence of a blacklist further confirms this, allowing for free and unrestricted trading.\n\nNonetheless, there is a slight concern in regards to lack of anti-whale measures, which can potentially lead to market manipulation by large holders. Additionally, the token is mintable. This means that the token supply can increase, which could potentially dilute the value of the currency over time, depending on how this feature is managed. \n\nIn terms of adoption, SUSHI shines with over 120,951 holders and more than 358 liquidity providers which is a strong sign of its acceptance in the market. Furthermore, its listing on a decentralized exchange (dex) is standard, further broadening its reach amongst the crypto community.\n\nFinally, not to be overlooked is the thorough assessment of its codebase. No high, medium or low severity issues have been discovered, a detail that speaks volumes about the integrity of the token's technical framework. This suggests a robust and secure token that provides traders with confidence in its functionality and longevity. All in all, the audit provides reassurance about SUSHI's value and potential on the cryptocurrency marketplace.","table":{"token_name":"SushiToken","token_symbol":"SUSHI","is_honeypot":"0","blacklisted":"0","external_functions":16,"internal_functions":28,"private_functions":1,"view_functions":15,"pure_functions":0,"payable_functions":0,"total_functions":56,"number_of_medium_severity_issues":0,"number_of_high_severity_issues":0,"number_of_low_severity_issues":0,"is_antiwhale":"0","buy_tax":"0","holder_count":"120951","is_mintable":"1","is_in_dex":"1","is_open_source":"1","lp_holder_count":"358","total_supply":"250204041.900080858088585544","sell_tax":"0"}}}
