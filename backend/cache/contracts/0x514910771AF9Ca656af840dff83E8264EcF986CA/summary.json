{"time":1706377519200,"data":{"text":"The audit results for the ChainLink Token, signified by the symbol LINK, present a secure and healthy token profile. There is no sell tax, which is favorable for those looking to trade the token, and the buy tax stands at a standard rate of 0.01%. This setup encourages unhindered and balanced trading, promoting a healthy market implementation.\n\nThe audit findings highlight that LINK is not a honeypot, indicating that the currency is not simply set up to lure investors only to disappear. This is a common occurrence and therefore the absence of it is a positive consideration. However, it's important to note that LINK does not feature antiwhale mechanisms, which could potentially allow larger accounts to manipulate the market. Nevertheless, the token is not mintable, ensuring token scarcity and therefore potentially higher value over time. \n\nIn addition to these characteristics, LINK does not practice blacklisting, enabling unrestricted trading. This aspect further asserts that the token operates on a flexible and non-exclusive basis, making it attractive for a wide range of users. ChainLink Token is listed on a decentralized exchange (dex), which is standard for most cryptocurrencies and bolsters its legitimacy.\n\nWith over 716,164 holders recorded, itâ€™s clear that ChainLink Token enjoys robust adoption, suggesting good market standing and user trust. Having more than four liquidity providers (LP) holders is another promising factor, offering stability to the token's market. \n\nThe audit detected no high, medium, or low severity issues within LINK's codebase. This is an excellent sign of robustness and security, showcasing that ChainLink Token, to date, operates with a negligible risk landscape. The absence of any notably significant risks underlines an exceptional degree of trustworthiness and reliability, further reinforcing the potential value of this token.","table":{"token_name":"ChainLink Token","token_symbol":"LINK","is_honeypot":"0","blacklisted":"0","external_functions":20,"internal_functions":4,"private_functions":2,"view_functions":6,"pure_functions":0,"payable_functions":0,"total_functions":26,"number_of_medium_severity_issues":0,"number_of_high_severity_issues":0,"number_of_low_severity_issues":0,"is_antiwhale":"0","buy_tax":"0.0001","holder_count":"716164","is_mintable":"0","is_in_dex":"1","is_open_source":"1","lp_holder_count":"4","total_supply":"1000000000","sell_tax":"0"}}}
