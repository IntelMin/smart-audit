{"time":1706377595503,"data":{"text":"The audit conclusion for the Shezmu (SHEZMU) cryptocurrency token indicates a few key points of interest for prospective investors or those interested in the digital asset. It is noted that there's a 6% sell tax in place, which is slightly higher than average. However, the absence of a buy tax is a major positive, allowing for frictionless purchases.\n\nInstances of foul play such as honeypots are absent within Shezmu, although there's also no antiwhale mechanism. This means there's nothing preventing large token holders (\"whales\") from potentially manipulating the market. Regardless, unrestricted trading is possible due to the lack of a blacklist policy.\n\nThe token's ability to mint offers potential for increased supply, which can either be a positive or negative depending on one's perspective. But it is generally acknowledged that this feature adds an extra level of flexibility for the token's management.\n\nYet another positive attribute is Shezmu's listing on a decentralized exchange (dex), which is generally an expected feature for tokens. The asset's adoption is fairly strong, boasting over 1058 token holders and more than 8 liquidity providers. \n\nPerhaps most encouraging is the absence of any high, medium, or low severity issues during the audit. This shows that the token's codebase is secure and robust, devoid of significant risks. All in all, the audit paints a largely positive picture of Shezmu, minus some considerations like the high sell tax and the lack of an antiwhale mechanism.","table":{"token_name":"Shezmu","token_symbol":"SHEZMU","is_honeypot":"0","blacklisted":"0","external_functions":33,"internal_functions":92,"private_functions":9,"view_functions":27,"pure_functions":0,"payable_functions":0,"total_functions":217,"number_of_medium_severity_issues":0,"number_of_high_severity_issues":0,"number_of_low_severity_issues":0,"is_antiwhale":"0","buy_tax":"0","holder_count":"1058","is_mintable":"1","is_in_dex":"1","is_open_source":"1","lp_holder_count":"8","total_supply":"404326.367796567716111712","sell_tax":"0.06"}}}
